Please specify the way of running program at the top of the README:
everyone have different way of running, and it is hard to follow it if you don't tell  your running environment.
2.

Update based on readable code from user
 
3. 
Based on the code that is already exist, following have been changed/
The code specified the length of argument without stating meaning on the file. It is hard to read without checking requirement
Hence I added the meaning of each code which has specific numbers.

4. 
To add functions, I did not modify the while loop which has original algorithm; in order to keep expansibility.

5. 
For README format, I followed the original format.
